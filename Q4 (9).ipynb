    "In Python, a multiprocessing pool is a mechanism provided by the multiprocessing module to manage a group of worker processes efficiently. The primary purpose of using a multiprocessing pool is to parallelize the execution of a function over multiple input data points, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores and achieving better performance when dealing with CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A multiprocessing pool consists of a fixed number of worker processes that are created when the pool is initialized. These worker processes are used to perform tasks in parallel. The pool manages the distribution of the tasks across the workers and collects their results, providing a convenient interface for handling the parallel execution."
